description: The Eyes of Asia consists of four letters written by a fictional soldier
  of the Indian Army--part of the British Forces in WWI--serving in Europe and Africa.
  Based on Kipling's firsthand experience with Indian soldiers, the letters are an
  intriguing form of fiction and an unusual portrait of these lesser-known combatants
  in the Great War.
